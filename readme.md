## Description

_{A countdown timer that shows days, hours, minutes, and seconds. Time inputed is done in minutes. It will accept partial minutes such as .5 for 30 seconds. A default time of 25 minutes is provided. When the timer is completed, another time may be entered without refreshing the page. }_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

_{Download the files and open index.html. Make sure that javascript is available in the browser or the application will not function. There are multiple CDNs used so an open web connection is recommended for best performance.}_

## Known Bugs

_{If a timer is already running and another timer needs to be run instead, running a second timer in the same window without refreshing the page will cause the screen to go back and forth between timers. If the first timer was an error, simply refresh the page and enter the correct timer. If 2 timers need to be run simultainiously, run 2 timers in different windows.}_
